# k-armed-bandits
> Simple reinforcement learning solution to the k-Armed bandit problem.

The k-Armed bandit problem demonstrates the concept of e-greedy action selection, where the agent seeks to maximize returns over a number of runs by balancing 
exploration and exploitation of the search space.

In this implementation, the we plot the average return for different values for epsilon (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) to search for the optimal value which returns the most
reward over time.
